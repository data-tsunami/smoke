## Smoke - Web interface for Spark and Hadoop

Web interface to execute **Scala** jobs in **Spark**. The output generated by `spark-shell` is sent to the browser while it is being generated using **websockets**. Requires passwordless connection to the cluster using `ssh` (for launching the job). Uses `spark-shell` in `yarn client` mode.

This is at an early development stage, but it's functional and easy to install (at least in Ubuntu 14.04).

Looking for **screenshots**? See at the bottom of the page.

## Download and run

###### Step 1: Clone this repo and enter into it

    $ git clone https://github.com/data-tsunami/smoke
    $ cd smoke

###### Step 2: Create the virtualenv and install requirements.txt

    $ virtualenv -p python2.7 virtualenv
    $ ./virtualenv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

###### Step 3: Configure (you'll find the instructions in smoke_settings_local_SAMPLE.py)

    $ cp smoke_settings_local_SAMPLE.py smoke_settings_local.py
    $ vim smoke_settings_local.py

###### Step 4: Run:

    $ ./run_uwsgi.sh

This script will run Django's `syncdb`, `migrate` and `collectstatic`. Then will start `uWSGI` and the `Celery` worker.

## Requirements

Smoke is developed and tested with:

* Python 2.7
* Hadoop 2.4.1
* Spark 1.0.2
* Redis
* Ubuntu 14.04, with at least:
  * python-dev
  * libssl-dev
  * openssh-client
  * python-virtualenv



## FAQ and troubleshooting

###### Make uWSGI listen in other address/port

Use the environment variable `SMOKE_UWSGI_HTTP`. For example:

    $ env SMOKE_UWSGI_HTTP=127.0.0.1:7777 ./run_uwsgi.sh

###### ERROR: Cannot connect to redis://127.0.0.1:6379/4

You get a lot of this in your console:

    [2014-08-22 23:44:02,232: ERROR/MainProcess] consumer: Cannot connect to redis://127.0.0.1:6379/4: Error 111 connecting to 127.0.0.1:6379. Connection refused..
    Trying again in 2.00 seconds...

Install and start Redis! On Ubuntu 14.04, you must run:

    $ sudo apt-get install -y redis-server
    $ sudo service redis-server start


###### ERROR: you need to build uWSGI with SSL support to use the websocket handshake api function

You forgot to install the required packages. Install `libssl-dev` and reinstall the `virtualenv` requirements.

###### Run in Docker

If you are brave enough, see instructions at [Dockerfile!](Dockerfile).

###### Security

As Smoke is currently in its initial development, security isn't the main goal yet.

## Next steps

* Load Spark results on IPython Notebook
* Kill running jobs
* Better integratoin with Yarn API
* Save & edit scripts

## TODO

* ~~Refactor parser of console output~~
* ~~Refactor actions to reuse code~~
* Document and fix security issues!
* Create a 'check' script, to be used to check configuration after install
* Add Scala utilities to be used in scripts
* Add pagination to job history
* Evaluate paramiko instead of Popen + ssh. See: http://www.paramiko.org/
* Evaluate 'load'. See: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/repl/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/repl/SparkILoop.scala
* Docker: mount SQlite database in volume

###### Spark Tasks progress

The logs lines are parsed looking for **TaskSetManager** and **Finished TID**, and the progress is parsed and reported (in this case, progress was 4 task finished of 10):

    14/08/23 12:48:53 INFO scheduler.DAGScheduler: Completed ShuffleMapTask(1, 0)
    14/08/23 12:48:53 INFO scheduler.TaskSetManager: Finished TID 0 in 7443 ms on hadoop-hitachi80gb.hadoop.dev.docker.data-tsunami.com (progress: 4/10)
